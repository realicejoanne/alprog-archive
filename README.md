# How to use C++ for Algorithm Programming?

Tools: Text Editor (Suggested: MinGW/CodeBlocks)

Make the program:
1. Initialize program with this format.
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
   //code here
}
```
2. Make the code and run it.

In Algorithm Programming, there are several subtopics I learned:
1. Introduction
2. Decision Making (If-else, Switch)
3. Looping (For, While, Do...While)
4. Function
5. Array
6. Record
7. File
